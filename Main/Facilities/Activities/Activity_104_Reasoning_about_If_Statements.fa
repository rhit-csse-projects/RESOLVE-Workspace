	-- Basic
	-- Reasoning about if statements needs reasoning about the correctness of all possible paths
	-- Activities 1: Understand, reason, and inquire

	-- Guided
	-- Activity 2a: Replace the swap statement with assignment statement and attempt to verify
	-- Activity 2b: Replace the swap statement with a wrong assignment statement and attempt to verify

	-- Activity 3: Read 3 integers, write suitable statements to store the max in X,
	--              and then write a confirm assertion to capture the effect of your code

	-- Activity 4: Explore if-then-else statements

	Operation Main();
	Procedure
		Var X, Y: Integer;
		
		Write_Line("Enter two numbers");
		Read(X);
		Read(Y);
		Remember;    -- remembers the values of X and Y here as #X and #Y
		
        If (X < Y) then
			X :=: Y;        -- this is a swap statement available on all types of objects
		end;
		
		Confirm X = max(#X, #Y); 
--        Confirm Y = min(#X, #Y);

		Write("Maximum: ");
		Write_Line(X);
		Write("Minimum: ");
		Write_Line(Y);
